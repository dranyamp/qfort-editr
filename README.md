Web editor for Qfort blueprints

This is a utility for creating [Quickfort](http://www.joelpt.net/quickfort/) blueprints for the wonderfully gory game [Dwarf Fortress](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/)

Use the top input to update the comment. Use the arrow keys to navigate the pseudo-spreadsheet, and click export to receive a CSV blueprint.

The utility is in a very early state, but I plan on adding a bunch of features.
